This repo contains a small program to serve as a companion to playing monopoly! 

### History
- During some games of monoply with my siblings and cousins some games Ill buy certain propers and people land their every turn it felt like! and the same properties in another game will return dust lol. So i wanted a neat tool to track whihc properies do me good (and dirty) during the game!
