    # Utilize QtPy to figure out how to make a UI that has some stats and buttons that will
    # 1. Allow player to say that bought a property
    # 2. Buy Sell Houses / Hotels
    # 3. Log Opponent landed on their property
    # 4. Keep track of total profit from owned properties
    # May make some github project issues to track these!

    # will also need to be definityive on how the total profit will be. maybe a mode to start from price put in, or pure profits. Or Both!
    # will also need to deciede will the method have barriers for over buying and over selling properites? or will buttons be disabled. need to exeperiment with QtPy
